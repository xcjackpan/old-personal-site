			<h2>01/10/2018</h2>

			<p>
				This is going to be sort of meta – since I’m writing about my website on my website – but bear with me. I started thinking about how I wanted my website to look way back in September, which was actually before I knew anything about HTML or CSS. Though the actual designs I came up with during this time were questionable at best, they were at least helpful in narrowing down what I wanted to feature on my site. 
			</p>

			<h3>The Coding</h3>

			<p>
				I didn’t really think about my website again until I started trying to teach myself HTML and CSS over the Christmas break. I initially tried to salvage an early design, but it just didn’t feel right. So, I chose to start over fresh. 

				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				I ran into my first obstacle immediately: given that I had only picked up HTML and CSS a few days ago, making things look the way I wanted was hard. There was really no clever solution around this problem, so I worked through a bunch of tutorials – making sure I understood what was going on – until I was comfortable enough to get the “core” features on my site. Even still, I ended up having to cut out a few features just because I couldn’t find a clean way to implement them. I actually still have them written in my notebook under “to-do”, so they’re still on my radar – when I have some more practice.
			</p>

			<h3>The Design</h3>

			<p>
				Overall though, the most difficult aspect of building my site was wrestling with the fact that it was mine. How do you wholly capture a person through a website? This is also still a problem I’m working on, as I’m still not completely satisfied with the design at the moment. The layout is pretty, sure, but it doesn’t feel like Jack’s website. This is a pretty difficult point to put into words, so below are a few older versions of my site that I felt didn’t quite reflect me.
			</p>

			<div class="firstsite">
				<img src="img/4.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="caption">
				<p>One of my first attempts. This one doesn't really have a personality — pretty mountains, though.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="secondsite">
				<img src="img/1.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="caption">
				<p>I'd say these feel a little bit more like me, but even still it was a bit too cookie-cutter.</p>
			</div>


			<p style="padding-bottom: 50px">
				I’ll almost certainly write another post on this topic in the future (most likely when I inevitably redesign my site again), so I’ll leave off with this cool quote I found while researching layouts for my site.
