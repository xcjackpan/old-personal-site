			<h2>01/10/2018</h2>

			<p>
				This is going to be sort of meta – since I’m writing about my website on my website – but bear with me. I started thinking about how I wanted my website to look way back in September, which was actually before I knew anything about HTML or CSS. Though the actual designs I came up with during this time were questionable at best, they were at least helpful in narrowing down what I wanted to feature on my site. 
			</p>

			<h3>Learning to Learn</h3>

			<p>
				I didn’t really think about my website again until I started trying to teach myself HTML and CSS over the Christmas break. I had about a week off from class and I wanted to have a decent-looking site up before school (and assignments) began. I initially tried to salvage an early design, but it just didn’t feel right. So, I chose to start over fresh.

				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				I ran into an obstacle immediately: given that I had only picked up the language a few days ago, making things look the way I wanted was hard. I did a few tutorials before jumping right in, but I was pretty excited to get started so I decided to figure out the rest as I went along. However, this mentality quickly became a problem which really reached its peak when I was working on the resume section on my site. Because I was so new to web development, a simple two-column layout ended up being a monumental challenge. My first attempt at it was – to put it lightly – ridiculous. I had the text in two divs and played around with inline padding and widths until I got the text more or less where I wanted. It actually looked sort of decent until you resized the window, at which point everything fell apart. My code during this time was so messy and incomprehensible that it might as well have been randomly generated. It was here when I realized I wouldn’t be able to just “figure it out”.  So I worked through a bunch more tutorials until I knew enough to build a properly formatted two-column resume. 

				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				I really wish there was some clever programming trick to talk about here, but to be honest, nearly all the problems I faced were the result of being completely new to the language. With a different mentality, I was able to get the rest of my site up and running without too much difficulty. When I ran into more problems later on while developing the media queries, the solution was once again to work through some more resources online. And yet even still, I ended up having to cut out a few features just because I couldn’t find a clean way to implement them. The coding process ended up being more of an exercise in picking up a new language and figuring out the right strategies for learning.
			</p>

			<h3>Good Design is Hard</h3>

			<p>
				If you Google “how to make media queries”, you get a bunch of pretty clear guides with some easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions. However, if you Google “how to design a good website”, you get a bunch of articles with really vague advice that’s not really even applicable a lot of the time. At least that’s how I felt when I was trying to figure out how to design my site. As a result, most of the learning process here came from experimenting rather than online resources. 

				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				I quickly found out that a lot of UI features that sounded cool in my head are really unintuitive and annoying in practice. For example, the logo on the navigation bar used to be a clickable link that would take you to the very top of the page – except that most people whom I showed the site tried to click it while they were already at the top of the page. I took this to figure that it wasn’t clear what that button did, which is a pretty good indicator of bad design. 

				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				However, I found that the hardest overall aspect of my website to design was the fact that it was my site. It’s relatively easy to make a site that looked pretty, but it was significantly harder to make one that also captured a personality. A site’s personality is the combined result of several properties: typography, spacing, color, to name a few. Ideally, my site would have a personality that reflected my own, but that’s a lot harder to pin down than anticipated. I’ve already reworked my site a couple of times trying to get the right feel each time. I haven’t got it yet – even with the current iteration as of writing – but I think I’m getting closer.

				<img src="img/1.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="caption">
				<p>One of my first attempts. This one doesn't really have a personality — pretty mountains, though.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="secondsite">
				<img src="img/2.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="caption">
				<p>I'd say this feels a little bit more like me, but even still it was a bit too generic.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="thirdsite">
				<img src="img/3.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="caption">
				<p>The current design as of writing. It definitely has a more defined personality, though I'm not exactly sure it's what I'm going for.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Final Remarks</h3>

			<p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
				Building my a personal website was overall a great introductory step into the world of web development and it also served as a great exercise for learning HTML and CSS. Though things aren’t completely finalized yet, I’m pretty happy with how things look as of now – though I’ll definitely revisit the design in the future.
